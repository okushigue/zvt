SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION
------------------------------
This analysis explores whether core quantum phenomena emerge from the
mathematical structure of the Riemann zeta zeros:

1. SUPERPOSITION: Modeled as interference of oscillations exp(i γ_n t).
   Result: Interference patterns show probabilistic behavior similar to |ψ|².

2. WAVEFUNCTION COLLAPSE: Searched for abrupt changes in zero spacing statistics.
   Result: Some regions show sudden shifts, resembling measurement-induced collapse.

3. ENTANGLEMENT: Analyzed long-range correlations in zero sequence.
   Result: Persistent correlations suggest non-local connections akin to entanglement.

Conclusion: The zeta zero distribution exhibits mathematical analogs of quantum behavior,
suggesting that quantum mechanics may emerge from number-theoretic principles.
