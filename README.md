ZVT proposes a fundamental connection between the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function (γₙ) and the laws of physics. An extensive analysis of 2,001,052 high-precision zeros, computed by Odlyzko, reveals statistically significant correlations with a wide range of fundamental physical constants and parameters.
